C debugging

0-main.c: Tests for a positive_or_negative() function.

1-main.c: Comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2-largest-number.c: Prints the largest of three integers.

3-print-remaining-days.c: Converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.

PS: the rubberduck debugging style is cool.
